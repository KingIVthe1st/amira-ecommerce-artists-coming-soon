# Headline Centering Fix - December 21, 2025

## Issue
The "Ecommerce for Artists" headline was not properly centered on the page.

## Root Cause
Multiple conflicting CSS files with different centering approaches were causing layout issues:
- `headline-fix.css` - Used !important overrides but had white-space: nowrap
- `force-center.css` - Nuclear approach but still had alignment issues
- Conflicting flexbox and block display properties

## Solution Applied
1. Created a comprehensive `headline-center-fix.css` that:
   - Uses flexbox for proper centering
   - Removes white-space: nowrap to allow proper text flow
   - Centers both the container and individual title lines
   - Maintains the gradient effect on "for Artists"
   - Includes mobile responsive adjustments

2. Removed conflicting CSS files from HTML:
   - Removed `headline-fix.css`
   - Removed `force-center.css`
   - Added `headline-center-fix.css`

## Key CSS Changes
- Hero title uses `display: flex` with `flex-direction: column`
- Title lines use `display: inline-block` for proper centering
- Removed all positioning transforms and absolute positioning
- Added proper mobile breakpoints

## Status
✅ Fix deployed to GitHub Pages (commit: 1a93125)
✅ Should be live within 2-5 minutes
