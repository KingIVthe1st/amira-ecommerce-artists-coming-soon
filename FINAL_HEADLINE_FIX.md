# Headline Centering Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue Resolved
The "Ecommerce for Artists" headline was appearing misaligned with "Ecommerce" right-aligned and "for Artists" left-aligned.

## Solution Applied (3-Layer Approach)

### 1. CSS Fix - `ultimate-headline-center.css`
- Changed both title lines to `display: block` for perfect centering
- Removed all positioning, transforms, and float properties
- Applied `text-align: center` to all elements with `!important`
- Set `width: 100%` on all elements to ensure proper block behavior

### 2. Inline Styles (Immediate Effect)
Added critical inline styles in the `<head>` section:
```css
.hero-title { text-align: center !important; display: block !important; width: 100% !important; }
.title-line { display: block !important; text-align: center !important; width: 100% !important; }
```

### 3. JavaScript Fallback - `headline-center-emergency.js`
- Applies centering styles via JavaScript after DOM loads
- Ensures centering even if CSS fails to load
- Targets `.hero-title` and all `.title-line` elements

## Key Changes
- Both "Ecommerce" and "for Artists" are now block-level elements
- Each line takes full width and centers its text
- Gradient effect on "for Artists" is preserved
- Mobile responsive adjustments included

## Files Modified
1. Created: `styles/ultimate-headline-center.css`
2. Created: `scripts/headline-center-emergency.js`  
3. Updated: `index.html` (added new CSS, inline styles, and JS)
4. Removed references to: `headline-fix.css`, `force-center.css`, `headline-center-fix.css`
